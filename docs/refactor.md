# Bookmark App Refactor Plan: Operation-Based Architecture

## Overview

This refactor moves from IndexedDB-as-primary-storage to an operation-based architecture where:
- **Server**: Maintains current state, processes operations, broadcasts to clients
- **Client**: Keeps state in memory, queues operations in IndexedDB, syncs when online
- **Sync**: HTTP for sending operations, SSE for receiving operations from other clients

**CONSTRAINT**: Reuse the existing shared worker infrastructure (`client/src/workers/`) - only modify business logic and content, not the overall architecture. The existing Comlink-based setup with DatabaseManager, ConnectionManager, EventManager, SyncManager, and OperationProcessor should be preserved and adapted for the new operation-based approach.

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup

### 1.1 Server Foundation
- [x] Create operation types and interfaces
  - [x] Create `server/src/types/operations.ts`
  - [x] Define `Operation` interface with id, type, namespace, payload, clientId, timestamp
  - [x] Define operation types: CREATE_BOOKMARK, CREATE_FOLDER, UPDATE_BOOKMARK, UPDATE_FOLDER, DELETE_BOOKMARK, DELETE_FOLDER, MOVE_BOOKMARK, MOVE_FOLDER
  - [x] Define validation schemas for each operation type

- [x] Create operation validation system
  - [x] Create `server/src/services/OperationValidator.ts`
  - [x] Implement operation structure validation
  - [x] Implement payload validation per operation type
  - [x] Implement namespace access validation

- [x] Create operation deduplication system
  - [x] Add `operation_log` table to database schema with operation metadata
  - [x] Create `server/src/services/OperationDeduplicator.ts`
  - [x] Implement operation ID checking and storage per endpoint
  - [x] Add client ID and timestamp tracking for each operation type

- [x] Create operation service per entity type
  - [x] âœ… `server/src/services/bookmark.service.ts` already handles both bookmarks and folders - **REUSE**
  - [x] âœ… Operation methods already implemented: `createBookmark()`, `updateItem()`, `deleteItem()`, `moveItem()` - **REUSE**
  - [x] âœ… Operation methods already implemented: `createFolder()`, `updateItem()`, `deleteItem()`, `moveItem()` - **REUSE**
  - [x] âœ… Proper error handling and transaction support already implemented - **REUSE**

### 1.2 Client Foundation
âœ… **COMPLETED**

- [x] âœ… **Operation Types**: Updated existing `client/src/types/operations.ts` for server compatibility
  - [x] âœ… Updated Operation interface to match server (timestamp instead of clientCreatedAt)
  - [x] âœ… Updated OperationType enum for separate DELETE_BOOKMARK/DELETE_FOLDER, MOVE_BOOKMARK/MOVE_FOLDER
  - [x] âœ… Added QueuedOperation interface for client-side operation queue storage
  - [x] âœ… Enhanced payload interfaces to match server validation requirements

- [x] âœ… **Shared Worker**: Adapted existing infrastructure for operation-based architecture
  - [x] âœ… **OperationProcessor** - Updated to handle new operation types and QueuedOperation structure
  - [x] âœ… **DatabaseManager** - Updated to store QueuedOperation, fixed schema for timestamp index
  - [x] âœ… **SyncManager** - Updated to convert QueuedOperation to Operation for server sync
  - [x] âœ… **SharedWorker**, **EventManager**, **ConnectionManager** - **REUSE AS-IS** (excellent foundation)
  - [x] âœ… Memory-first approach with IndexedDB operation queue already implemented correctly

**Note**: The existing client infrastructure was much more advanced than initially assessed. The memory-first approach and operation queuing were already correctly implemented! Only needed type updates and queue structure changes.

## Phase 2: Core Sync Infrastructure

  - [x] âœ… Added OperationsController import and initialization
  - [x] âœ… Added 8 new operation endpoints: create-bookmark, create-folder, update-bookmark, update-folder, delete-bookmark, delete-folder, move-bookmark, move-folder
  - [x] âœ… Maintained existing bulk sync endpoint as legacy fallback
  - [x] âœ… All endpoints use operation validation and deduplication
