# Bookmark App Refactor Plan: Operation-Based Architecture

## Overview

This refactor moves from IndexedDB-as-primary-storage to an operation-based architecture where:
- **Server**: Maintains current state, processes operations, broadcasts to clients
- **Client**: Keeps state in memory, queues operations in IndexedDB, syncs when online
- **Sync**: HTTP for sending operations, SSE for receiving operations from other clients

**CONSTRAINT**: Reuse the existing shared worker infrastructure (`client/src/workers/`) - only modify business logic and content, not the overall architecture. The existing Comlink-based setup with DatabaseManager, ConnectionManager, EventManager, SyncManager, and OperationProcessor should be preserved and adapted for the new operation-based approach.

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup
