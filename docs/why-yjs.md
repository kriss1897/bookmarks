# Why integrate Yjs for this app

Summary
- Yjs is a Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) framework that gives realtime, multi-session sync, offline support, and automatic conflict resolution without locks or server-side merges.
- It fits the requirements: drag-and-drop reordering, moving items between folders, persisting open/close state, and live updates across sessions with minimal write amplification.

How Yjs helps for your requirements
- Add items/folders: locally create entries; Yjs syncs them to all sessions in milliseconds.
- Interleaved list (folders + bookmarks): represent the container’s children as a Y.Array; inserts/reorders are cheap.
- Drag-and-drop reorder/move: concurrent reorders converge deterministically; no mass “position” rewrites.
- Move between containers: delete+insert the same node reference; all peers converge.
- Folder open/close: keep as simple shared state (Y.Map) or ephemeral presence (Awareness) depending on whether you want it persisted and synced.
- Persistence across restarts: use IndexedDB in browser and LevelDB (or file) on the server to persist the CRDT state.
- Realtime multi-session: y-websocket broadcasts CRDT updates; no custom diffing or conflict logic needed.

How it works (internals, briefly)
- Each edit becomes a CRDT “item” with a unique ID (clientID, clock) and neighbor pointers.
- Concurrent inserts at the same spot are ordered deterministically by IDs, so all peers converge.
- Deletes are tombstones until garbage-collected; updates are binary and idempotent.

Data model with Yjs
- Y.Doc per namespace.
- Y.Array containers for ordered children lists:
  - Root children: ydoc.getArray('root')
  - Folder children: ydoc.getArray(`children:${folderId}`)
- Node records (folder/bookmark) in a Y.Map collection:
  - ydoc.getMap('nodes') keyed by nodeId → { type: 'folder'|'bookmark', label, url, icon, createdAt, ... }
- Folder open state:
  - Persisted: ydoc.getMap('folderOpen').set(folderId, true|false)
  - Ephemeral per-session: Awareness.setLocalStateField('openFolders', Set<id>)
- Optional: snapshot/backup service writes denormalized views to SQLite for search/reporting.

Why Yjs over SQL for ordering
- SQL position columns or linked lists either cause mass rewrites or require careful pointer updates and locking under concurrency.
- Yjs inserts are O(log n) integration with no global renumbering; concurrent edits merge automatically.
- Network payloads are small binary updates; server stays stateless w.r.t. conflict resolution.

Architecture
- Client: yjs + y-webrtc or y-websocket + y-indexeddb for local persistence.
- Server: y-websocket server (Node) + y-leveldb (or file-based) to persist Yjs updates per namespace.
- Authorization: enforce namespace access on the websocket path or token; optionally shard documents per namespace.

Performance and UX
- Fast local edits even offline; sync when online.
- Great for infinite scroll/virtualized lists; you can stream items from the Y.Array in order.
- Reorders do not cause thundering herds or heavy transactions.

Trade-offs and when not to use Yjs
- Random-access pagination by “page N” is less direct; prefer cursor/infinite scrolling or maintain a secondary index.
- Storage includes tombstones until GC; periodic compaction recommended.
- If you only need single-writer storage without realtime collaboration, a plain DB may be simpler.

Integration plan (minimal)
1) Add yjs to client; create/get a Y.Doc per namespace.
2) Connect via y-websocket provider to a small Node server; enable y-indexeddb persistence.
3) Model nodes in a Y.Map and container children as Y.Arrays; render via React with observers.
4) Implement DnD: on drop, splice in/out of the target Y.Array; update node parentId in the node map.
5) Store folder open state in a Y.Map; subscribe to changes for UI.
6) Add server persistence (y-leveldb) and optional snapshotter to SQLite for search or backups.

Security notes
- Use namespace-scoped websocket rooms; validate tokens on connect.
- Consider encrypting Yjs updates at rest if needed; Yjs itself is transport-agnostic.

Bottom line
- Yjs minimizes complexity for realtime ordering, movement, and sync, while guaranteeing convergence without manual conflict handling. It is a strong fit
